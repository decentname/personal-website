So you're probably wondering, what the heck is a Pomodoro technique? 

Well, it’s a time management technique where you split your day into brief intervals (usually 25 minutes), separated by quick breaks. Each​ interval​ is what we call a Pomodoro. Simple yet powerful, all you need to be able to follow this technique is a timer.

First, a little background: I heard about Pomodoro from a colleague who would swear by it. My first attempt was while we were still working out of offices (yes, that pre-pandemic thing), and it was an epic failure. I started an interval and within one minute, someone walked over to discuss something important. It was hard for me to comply with the technique in my work environment. Sometimes, I would just skip the breaks and end up working for hours on the same thing.

Then, entered the lockdown followed by work-from-home. I thought of experimenting with the technique once again, and here’s what happened:

__Bye Bye Procrastination__-

The short interval psyched me. It left me with no excuses to procrastinate, considering I had limited time to finish a task.

__Bye Bye Eye Strain__-

Being a software developer, my eyes spend 8 hours with my laptop followed by 4 hours with my mobile. My doctor urged me to take frequent pauses while working just to calm my eyes. Are you happy, doctor? Because my eyes are.

__Bye Bye Guilt Trips__-

Yes, no more feeling guilty about taking breaks. I could dance, dream, or even kill mosquitoes - I earned those breaks and nothing could take them away from me.

__Say Hello to Productivity__-

I could organize my tasks in a stronger manner and still focus on each task for prolonged periods. I could accomplish more jobs even though I was taking more breaks.

To conclude, I don’t know if this is going to work for me once I am back in office. Perhaps, it shines only if you have a contained environment like home. I will continue with Pomodoro technique as long as I am working from home. For those who dislike the 25 minute window, it’s not mandatory to stick to a fixed interval. I experiment with 25 to 45 minute intervals depending on my tasks. Go with the flow!
